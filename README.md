## Syllabus

### Week 1
**Key questions to ask** 

1. What really makes a VR VR? 

2. What is the computational process of transforming a 3D scene to what displayed to your eyes?

Introduction to VR/AR systems and basic graphics pipelines.

### Week 2
**Key questions to ask** 

1. What is the minimum viable product (MVP) for a VR? 

2. How should we turn a passion/dream to a workable engineering plan? 

3. What are the tradeoffs for different design plans?

VR design plans brain storming. There is no 'correct' answers for engineering. The problem we are facing is: 'Driven by your passion/goal, given limited resources, knowing what is your metrics to evaluate success, how to make your best possible plan and act on it.' Come up with a step-by-step hardware prototyping iteration plan. Start sourcing the hardware components based on your design.
