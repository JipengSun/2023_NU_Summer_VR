## Syllabus

### Week 1
**Key questions to ask** 

1. What really makes a VR VR? 

2. What is the computational process of transforming a 3D scene to what displayed to your eyes?

Introduction to VR/AR systems and basic graphics pipelines.

### Week 2
**Key questions to ask** 

1. What is the minimum viable product (MVP) for a VR? 

2. How could we turn a passion/dream into a workable engineering plan? 

3. What are the tradeoffs for different design plans?

VR design plans brain storming. There is no 'correct' answers for engineering. The problem we are facing is: 'Driven by your passion/goal, given limited resources, knowing what is your metrics to evaluate success, how to make your best possible plan and act on it.' Come up with a step-by-step hardware prototyping iteration plan. Start sourcing the hardware components based on your design.

### Week 3
**Key questions to ask** 

1. Given a designed MVP, which is a near eye monitor, how to draw/render scenes on that screen?

2. What is the logic of the graphics rendering pipeline?

3. How to use WebGL to implement the rendering pipeline?

### Week 4
**Key questions to ask** 

1. Will the current implemented binocular rendering effect work? Why it won't give us 3D effect?

2. What are the biological anatomy and functions of human binocular eyes? 

3. How should we change our graphics rendering logics to fit for human perception?

### Week 5
**Key questions to ask** 

1. To make it real, how to make a 2-cm far displayed image be perceived as 1.5-meter away from the users?

2. What are the poplur optical components of current near eye display? How do they work? What are the trade-offs?

3. Will the rendered images look distorted after adding lens between the display and eyes? If so, how should we correct them?
